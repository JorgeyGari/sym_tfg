# Development of a Symbolic Calculator from Scratch

The focus of this thesis is to develop a system from scratch that enables working with symbolic mathematical expressions to solve equations, integrals, or derivatives without requiring numerical values. The resulting system aims to match, in terms of functionality and efficiency, renowned symbolic mathematics programs such as Symbolab, Mathematica, or the Symbolic Toolbox and Symbolics.jl packages for MATLAB and Julia respectively.

The project aims to help comprehend the inner workings of the aforementioned programs and to assess whether it is feasible to have similar conveniences in symbolic computation as those provided by a simple pocket calculator in numerical computation.

Similar to how algebraic operations become trivial with a sufficient level of scientific knowledge, operating with symbolic expressions ceases to be a significant concern and can be delegated to a machine to facilitate the mathematical development of a problem.
